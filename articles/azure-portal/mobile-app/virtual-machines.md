# Monitor and Manage Virtual Machines from the Azure mobile app

The Azure Mobile App enables users to monitor, manage, and troubleshoot Virtual Machines (VMs) on the go, providing quick access to status checks, critical operations, and track metrics from their mobile devices.

## Use cases and scenarios

Some common use cases and scenarios supported include: 

- On-the-go management – Restart a VM if it becomes unresponsive. 
- Incident response – Receive an alert and immediately check VM health. 
- Access control – Quickly check who has permissions to manage a VM. 
- Monitoring & Status Checks – View VM health, performance metrics, and activity logs. 

## Capabilities of Virtual Machines in the Azure mobile app

In the Azure Mobile App, sign in and select Virtual Machines from the home screen or use the search function to find a specific VM. Tap on a VM to view its details, performance metrics, and available management actions. Depending on the VM type, you can perform various operations to monitor and manage your resources efficiently. These operations include:

- Tap **Start** to power on a VM. 
- Tap **Stop** to shut down a running VM. 
- Tap **Restart** to reboot a VM. 
- Tap **Connect** to establish a remote session. 
- Tap **Hibernate** to save a VM’s state to disk and power it down. 
- Tap **Auto-shutdown** in the Operations section of the Virtual Machine details view to configure the auto-shutdown schedule. 
- Tap **Access Control** (IAM) in the Management section of the Virtual Machine details view to configure a user’s access and role.

The Virtual Machine feature in the Azure Mobile App provides essential management capabilities but does not include the full functionality available in the Azure portal.
